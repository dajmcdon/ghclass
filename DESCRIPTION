Description: This  package is designed to enable instructors to 
    efficiently manage their courses on GitHub. It has a wide range 
    of functionality for managing organizations, teams, repositories, 
    and users on GitHub and helps automate most of the tedious and 
    repetitive tasks around creating and distributing assignments.
    It has been renamed so as not to conflict with the original
    CRAN version of ghclass.
